# MNX Voice Videos, Docs & FAQ

## Why VoIP?

Unlike on-premise systems, your VoIP phone system can be taken anywhere. The flexibility of VoIP provides endless possible configurations (which we help you define) to match your business processes.

## Can I keep my phone numbers?

Yes! We have a thorough process to port you numbers that will ensure almost no downtime (typically less than a few minutes) during the port process.

## How fast does my Internet need to be?

A good rule of thumb is 100 Kb/s per active phone call. For a 10 user office, this would equate to 1 Mb/s of upload and 1 Mb/s of download bandwidth dedicated to voice service.
